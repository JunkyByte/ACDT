# ACDT
Tangent Based Manifold Approximation with locally linear models.

This is an implementation project for a course I did during my math Bachelor degree.
There might be mistakes in the implementation, not all details and tests have been reimplemented.

You can find the presentation for the seminar [here](presentation/presentation.pdf)
